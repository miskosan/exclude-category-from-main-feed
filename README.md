# Exclude category from Wordpress main feed

Exclude category from Wordpress main rss feed. The category feed itself is still available.

This can be useful when using Blubrry podcasting plugin in Wordpress, when using category podcasting option and there only needs to be only one of the podcasts included in main feed.
